# Beer Guide App

An app written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and compiled using Adobe Phonegap for Android (tested) and Windows Phone (untested but should work).

It has two functions:

 - **Beer Search**: Uses the BreweryDB API to show information about a beer of your choice
 - **Pub Finder**: Uses the Yelp Fusion API to show a list of local pubs along with some basic information
